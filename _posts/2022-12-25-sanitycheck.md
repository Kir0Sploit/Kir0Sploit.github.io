Hi! The information security community in Malaysia is really active right now as there are many cyber security events being held, including security conferences, security exhibitions, and CTF competitions. Yesterday, I joined the largest Malaysia Capture the Flag competition, known as Wargames Malaysia 2022. Participants can compete in different categories, such as the student category and the professional category. I joined as a student, under the name "St4ckBuff3r." I don't want to talk much, so let's take a look at the challenges that I was able to solve.

## Boot2root: Sanity Check

This challenge is not really a challenge, as stated in the description. This challenge is only to introduce a boot2root category.

As you can see below, there is guidelines which told us where to find a user and root flag.

Without thinking much, I logged in remote ssh as user and find a flag.
